JavaScript Portfolio Project
Project Deliverables
For the JavaScript phase of the software engineering course I am doing, we were told to build a Single Page Application (SPA) with the following requirements:
1.	Your app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.
2.	Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.
3.	Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page. 

App: Simple classic cocktail recipe app with recipes for nine cocktails and the ability to like each individual cocktail
API used: TheCocktailDB.com 
Basic code structure: indivdual fetch and display functions for each individual cocktail using the API data for the cocktail name, images, ingredients, measures and instructions and event listeners for each like button.
